                    h1 How much will my project cost?

                        | The short answer is, 
                        | I work on an hourly rate.  I can quote most projects based on my best guess of how 
                        | long it'll take to build.  The more a project's goals change once production begins,
                        | the less accurate my quote will become.
                      p 
                        | Projects come in all size and complexities.  I've been making them for so long, 
                        | I've learned best practices for most of the projects people have in mind.
                        | The more you know what your project is not and specifically what
                        | the Product you will be happy with is, the better my estimate 
                        | of how much time it will take. I make it somewhat more complex by having different 
                        | rates for different kinds of clients. In my mind, big corporations can afford to pay
                        | more than small business or struggling artist.  
                        | I'd be happy to send you my rates in an e-mail.

                          | The short answer is,
                          | I use every technology I have the time to learn.  I crave technologies on the cutting edge,
                          | Be they in the realm of filmmaking, web architecture or beyond into virtual reality, 3d-printing,
                          | and the like.  I would love to get paid to learn something on the very forefront of thought.

                          | Most of my experience is in Ruby and Javascript using the CanJS and Rails frameworks.
                          | I'm less-likely to accept work on API's and frameworks older than 2004 when Rails sprung up.  
                          | I love languages that prioritize developer happiness.  Developer happiness prioritizes elegance and dynamic runtime
                          | compiled possibilities for further elegance in API building.  They also happen to be where reside the 
                          | best communities and tools for creating successful businesses out of the seed of an idea.

                          | It's also probably worth mentioning the technologies stuff I'm just going to say no to, so you can move on.
                          | I don't code entreprise, I code open source.  So Cold Fusion, .NET, and Java aren't at the top
                          | of my list to learn.  I also can but usually don't want to waste time in pre-built CMS's and
                          | other shortcut, technology free products with one exception.  Joomla, Drupal, Expression Engine
                          | and the like, I'm into doing frontend javasccript animations, but the backend doesn't interest me.
                          | I have nothing against their community or their creators.  In my view they are too general in scope and too tied to plugins and other non-sense to offer
                          | what turns out to be a very clumbsy to maintain and edit and ultimately a very breakable product that
                          | I can't in good conscience recommend anyone rest their business's ability to thrive on those kinds of technologies.  The tools
                          | I use are elegant and precise and they are backed up by automating testing tools that proves they're unbreakable.

                        | The short answer is,
                        | I help small business and artists succeed using my skills in filmmaking and web technology.
                        | To that end I've produced promotional videos and websites for organizations and entrepreneurial 
                        | creative people for over a decade.  I've co-founded 4 start-ups.  I host a monthly meetup about independent filmmaking
                        | and entreprenuership.  I write like the dickens and really work far too hard for my own good.
                      p
                        | I have the people and resources to deliver professional, polished video at any budget.  I have most experience
                        | in mid and low budget shoots, but (be warned) the lower the budget, the cooler the subject matter better be.
